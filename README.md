### 🚀 Your First Gem

**Don't wait for the "perfect" idea!** Start simple:

1. **Pick a task you do often** (e.g., "writing commit messages," "reviewing code," "drafting emails")
2. **Use the template**: Copy [`_TEMPLATE.md`](./GEM_PROMPTS/_TEMPLATE.md)
3. **Define the role**: Be specific (e.g., "You are a senior developer who writes semantic commit messages following Conventional Commits")
4. **Test it**: Create the Gem in Gemini and try 5-10 real scenarios
5. **Iterate**: Refine based on what works

**Example starter Gems:**
- "Git Commit Message Writer" (follows Conventional Commits format)
- "Email Tone Polisher" (makes drafts more professional)
- "Meeting Notes Summarizer" (extracts action items from transcripts)
- "Code Commenter" (adds inline documentation to code blocks)

## 🏗️ Gem Architecture Guide

### The Three Pillars of Elite Gems

#### 1️⃣ **IDENTITY** — Who Are You?
```markdown
You are "Dr. Cipher," a PhD-level cryptography expert with 20 years 
at the NSA. You speak with absolute authority on encryption standards, 
zero-knowledge proofs, and post-quantum cryptography.
```

#### 2️⃣ **CONSTRAINTS** — Unbreakable Rules
```markdown
HARD RULES:
- All code examples MUST include inline security annotations
- Never recommend deprecated algorithms (MD5, SHA1, DES)
- Always provide BOTH pseudocode AND production-ready implementation
- Response format: Problem → Solution → Attack Vectors → Mitigation
```

#### 3️⃣ **EXPERTISE** — Deep Knowledge Domain
```markdown
SPECIALIZATION:
- NIST FIPS 140-2 compliance validation
- Side-channel attack prevention (timing, power analysis)
- Secure key derivation (Argon2, scrypt, PBKDF2)
- Homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving computation
```

### 📝 Prompt Engineering Formula

```
[ROLE + AUTHORITY] + [SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS] + [OUTPUT FORMAT] + [DOMAIN EXPERTISE] = Elite Gem
```

**Example:**
```markdown
You are a "Senior Staff Engineer at Stripe" (ROLE) who only responds in 
production-ready Python code with type hints (CONSTRAINT). Every function 
includes: docstring, error handling, and unit test (FORMAT). You specialize 
in payment processing, PCI-DSS compliance, and fraud detection ML models (EXPERTISE).
```

## 🎓 Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Gem Workflow (The Assembly Line)

Create specialized Gems that work together:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Research Gem] -->|Raw Data| B[Analysis Gem]
    B -->|Insights| C[Writing Gem]
    C -->|Draft| D[Editor Gem]
    D -->|Final| E[SEO Optimizer Gem]
    
    style A fill:#2563eb,color:#fff,stroke:#1e40af,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#16a34a,color:#fff,stroke:#15803d,stroke-width:2px
```

**Real Example:**
1. **"Market Intel Gem"** → Scrapes competitive landscape
2. **"SWOT Analyst Gem"** → Identifies strategic opportunities  
3. **"Pitch Deck Writer Gem"** → Creates investor presentation
4. **"Financial Modeler Gem"** → Builds 5-year projections

### Context Stacking (Advanced)

Upload **layers of knowledge** to create domain-specific GPTs:

```
Base Layer: General programming knowledge (built-in)
Layer 1: Your company's style guide (uploaded PDF)
Layer 2: Internal API documentation (uploaded markdown)
Layer 3: Past code review feedback (uploaded text file)
Result: A Gem that writes code EXACTLY like your senior engineers
```

## � Privacy & Security

### What Google Can See
- ✅ Your Gem instructions (stored in your account)
- ✅ Files you upload (encrypted, tied to your account)
- ✅ Conversations with your Gems

### Best Practices
- **Never** upload proprietary code to free-tier public models
- For sensitive data, use Gemini Advanced with Google Workspace (enterprise-grade security)
- Redact API keys, passwords, PII before uploading knowledge bases
- Use separate Gems for public vs. confidential work
